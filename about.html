SAARANG  the annual cultural fest of SASTRA UNIVERSITY.  
It is usually held for a span of three days. It is usually
held in the month of March. The competition was full of 
exciting and fun filled events-one such event which doubled
up as an effort on our part to celebrate Holi through music
and dance. The festival was to unify a diverse student body 
by celebrating the culture of the regions to which they 
belonged along with the culture of India as a whole. Through
this fest we can explore the talents of the students in fine arts.
